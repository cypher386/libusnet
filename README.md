libusnet
========

A light-weigh netmap-based network stack, which is based on FreeBSD network stack. The aim of the library is to provide an easy way for delelopers to build high performance servers with millions of connections. 

At this stage, the library is a proof-of-concept, which can easily reach line rate of 100Mb/1Gb/10Gb cards. 

For details of netmap, see [1].
